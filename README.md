CULane is a large scale challenging dataset for academic research on traffic lane detection. It is collected by cameras mounted on six different vehicles driven by different drivers in Beijing.

### U-Net Model

U-Net is a deep learning architecture commonly used for image segmentation tasks. It consists of a series of convolutional and downsampling layers, followed by upsampling and concatenation layers to produce a final segmentation mask. The network learns to predict the class labels for each pixel in the input image, resulting in a detailed segmentation of the image.

### Semantic Segmentation

Semantic Segmentation is a computer vision task in which the goal is to categorize each pixel in an image into a class or object. The goal is to produce a dense pixel-wise segmentation map of an image, where each pixel is assigned to a specific class or object.
